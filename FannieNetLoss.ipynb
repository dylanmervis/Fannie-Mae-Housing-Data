    "As we have done many times by now, we are going to summarize the data, see what missing values look like, and get a sense for what is a continuous variable and what is a categorical variable. As we have seen before, just because a variable is a number (i.e. `int64` for integers or `float64` for real numbers), it doesn't mean it's continuous. For example, below we see that `NUMBER_OF_BORROWERS` has 8 unique values. Those values are all numbers, so it is a `float64` variable, but that variable really is the number of borrowers on the loan, which is better thought of as a categorical variable. So, you should dig into the data glossary from the [Fannie Mae website](https://www.fanniemae.com/portal/funding-the-market/data/loan-performance-data.html) (direct link to glossary is [here](https://capitalmarkets.fanniemae.com/media/6931/display)) in order to understand what these variables mean.\n",

    "The data set contains all of the variables from the acquisition file, and we have pre-computed some additional independent variables (i.e. variables we can use to predict) that are not in the glossary:\n",
    "  * `CREDIT_SCORE_MIN`: The minimum of the borrower and the co-borrowers credit score.\n",
    "  * `ORIGINAL_VALUE`: The original value of the house. Computed from `ORIGINAL_LTV` (original loan to value) and `ORIGINAL_UPB` (original unpaid balance).\n",
    "  * `MSA_NAME`: The name of the MSA.\n",
    "  * `CENSUS_2010_POP`: The population in 2010 for the MSA.\n",
    "  \n",
    "We have also pulled in or pre-computed a number of variables that we cannot use for our prediction. This is because these variables are computed from the performance data while we are computing our dependent variable and if we used them, this would be future data leaking into the past (i.e. data we wouldn't have at decision time). These variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `ZERO_BALANCE_CODE`: The code indicated in the data set for when the mortgage is at zero balance.\n",
    "  * `LOAN_AGE`: The age of the loan in the data set.\n",
    "  * `NET_LOSS`: The net loss of a loan that has experienced a credit event (i.e. default).\n",
    "  * `NET_SEVERITY`: The net loss divided by the unpaid balance (i.e. percent loss).\n",
    "  * `LAST_STAT`: a letter indicating the last status of the loan in the data set. The values are as follows:\n",
    "      * `P`: Prepaid or matured loan.\n",
    "      * `T`: Third party sale of loan.\n",
    "      * `S`: Short sale.\n",
    "      * `R`: Repurchased loan.\n",
    "      * `F`: Deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.\n",
    "      * `N`: Note sale.\n",
    "      * `L`: Reperforming loan sale.\n",
    "      * `X`: Loan is delinquent, but status is unknown.\n",
    "      * `9`: The loan has been delinquent for at least 9 months.\n",
    "      * `1`-`8`: The loan has been delinquent for this many months.\n",
    "      * `C`: The loan is current.\n",
    "  * `LOAN_MODIFICATION_COSTS`: Costs due to modifying loan terms (i.e. reducing interest rate or forgiving principle).\n",

    "Imputing over categorical variables is challenging for three reasons. First, there are two equally reasonable ways to fill in missing values; you can either replace the missing values with the most common value in a category (for example \"N\" is the most common value for `FIRST_TIME_HOME_BUYER`, for any missing values in the dataset, you would replace it with \"N\"), or you can replace the value with some value that indicates it is missing (like the word \"MISSING\") and treat that like another category. The first method assumes that data is just accidentally missing, while the second assumes that there is something meaningful in it missing, which seems to be more common for categorical data than continuous data. As we've seen before `WheelTypeID` for the Carvana data set very much falls into this latter category of missing having meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way in which categorical variables are challenging is that often times there are many, many values for a categorical variable, which means that there are very few data points associated with each category. A good example of this is `MSA` for which there are `406` unique values. The MSAs with few observations are unlikely to be predictive, but we may still want to include the MSAs with lots of observations and then lump everything else into an \"OTHER\" category. We also may want to do this either by the percentage of the dataset (e.g. any category that is less than 10% of the data should be lumped in other) or by the number of samples in the dataset (e.g. any category that has fewer than 1000 samples should be lumped in \"OTHER\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The third reason that we imputing is challenging for categorical data is that the test set may have categories that we have never seen before. For example, if a city grows and a new MSA is added (or one is split), and we are trying to use the MSA to predict the expected `NET_LOSS`, then we won't have that MSA in the data we trained on. The simplest way to handle this is by lumping any of these observations into an \"OTHER\" category."

This is because any variable that we want to include in the model will always have to have a complete set of data whenever we predict, and we never know when a new row in the data will come in that has a missing value you have never seen before. If we go ahead and fit imputers for all of the columns, then we can safely impute on this new row without missing a beat.\n",

I also did not include `LOAN_IDENTIFIER`. This is because this is a unique value that identifies the loans, and if it is missing, then there is probably something wrong with that row of your data, and you should probably get an error if you try to predict on it.\n",

    "As we have seen, linear models like lasso or ridge regression typically require different kinds of features to be engineered from the variables. For example, we have seen that dummy variables are necessary in linear models, but not strictly necessary in tree based models (like regression trees and random forests). Additionally, interaction variables are the only way to get at certain effects in linear models, but tree based models can learn them directly. Another difference is with linear models you need to be more careful about is over-specifying the training data, i.e. if you have dummy variables you need to drop one column or the model is overspecified.\n",

First, we can let our trees do less work finding the most important relationships if we can construct some of them for it, and we can save some splitting that the tree would normally have to do if we provide some dummy variables. We can also help point it in the right direction if we provide some interactions.\n",

    "Additionally, we can't just give our tree a list of strings (which is what a categorical variable is). Computers work with numbers so we need to use numbers. So, if we don't use dummy variables for a particular variable, we will still need to _encode_ it. The most common way is with an ordinal encoding scheme. Ordinal encoding assigns an integer to each category, and then that number replaces the original category. We can do this with the `OrdinalEncoder` function from `sklearn`. The `OrdinalEncoder` works just like the imputers we have seen before, but instead of imputing values it replaces categories with numbers so that the trees can work with them. Note that it is important to `.fit()` on your training data, and then use the _same encoder_ to `.transform()` the validation set (and later the testing set). If you re-fit the encoder on the validation or testing set, you may end up with categories being assigned to different numbers and your model would just be acting randomly on things.\n",
